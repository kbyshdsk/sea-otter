# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a new repository with minimal setup. Currently contains only a basic README.md file.

## Development Setup

No package files, build systems, or development tools have been configured yet. When adding code to this repository, typical setup files to consider based on the technology stack chosen:

- Package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Build configuration
- Testing framework setup
- Linting and formatting tools

## Architecture

No code architecture has been established yet. This section should be updated once the project structure and technology choices are made.

# Claude Instructions

This repository is for building a simple browser-based game where an otter (sea otter) falls and the user interacts to catch or avoid it. The final app will be deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Goals

- Build a falling sea otter game using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no external frameworks at first)
- Keep the implementation readable and simple
- Create a deployable static web app
- Document the development process using Claude Code features to share as a Vibe Coding case study

## Preferred Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- No build tools or frameworks for initial MVP

## Style Guidelines

- Simple directory structure
- Semantic HTML
- Mobile-friendly if possible
# Project Purpose

This repository is for creating a casual falling-game web app featuring an animated sea otter character. The game will be deployed on GitHub Pages.

# Goals

- Build a simple HTML5/JS-based falling game ("sea-otter drop game")
- Animate a cute sea otter character falling or catching items
- Write development logs in a fun and expressive style (VibeCoding)
- Use Claude Code Assistant to scaffold, edit, and narrate development

# Constraints

- Must be runnable directly from GitHub Pages
- Prefer vanilla JS or minimal React if needed
- Keep assets lightweight (consider .svg or small sprite sheets)

# VibeCoding Style

- Encourage expressive commit messages and light-hearted commentary
- Output regular progress reports in Markdown
- Capture mistakes, ideas, and Claude prompts for future learning
